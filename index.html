                                                The Face Fixer application uses the Clarifai face detection API to take in a photo, 
                                                detect and place a resized CSS emoji with a perfect smile over it. 
                                                It also keeps a record of users login details, hash encrypted passwords and how many photos they have used the API with.
                                                Its front end is built using React, Flexbox, Tacyons.

                                                This is a site I built while learning some advanced CSS from Jonas Schmedtmann.
                                                This website is built almost entirely by CSS, it uses 
                                                only a few lines of Javascript. The website on display is using a float grid system and some amazing css,
                                                I have two more on Github that are built using Flexbox and CSS Grid respectfully, the links are below.

                            My name is Daniel Hardiman. 
                            
                            I left school and went to college to become a qualified electrician, but I have always been interested in technology,  problem solving and had a general interest in how things work.
                        </p>
                        <p class="aboutMe__details-2">
                            I spent around ten years as an electrician, getting involved in different areas of work and mainly working in London. I worked in the city for the last five years as part of a in-house team where I progressed myself further as an electrician and as a person. I had some great times there and met some amazing people, I was awarded the freedom of the city for my work and was also a production manager for a three stage music festival we put on for Oxfam which was another great experience.
                        </p>    
                        <p class="aboutMe__details-2">
                            Opportunity came along when I moved on to the role of a train engineer for three years.
                            Sadly the pace was a little too slow for me, the technical work where you really had to rack your brains was far and few between and the training there wasn’t what I had expected.
                        </p>  
                        <p class="aboutMe__details-2">    
                            During my free time I taught myself about import and export, affiliate marketing, how to build online stores using Shopify, amazon and eBay and how to target customers using Facebook advertising. Whilst this was interesting and brought in a nice side income I still found myself wanting more and any problem that I encountered I believed could have been solved by learning to code.
                            I have also been a life long martial artist and trained at least five days a week, I have been traveling for my sport in the past but I had always wanted to travel for longer and to train with the best in the world. 
                            This, my situation at work and Bitcoin led me to go traveling for a year.                         
                        </p>
                        <p class="aboutMe__details-3">
                            My fiancé and I began in Sri Lanka, we spent a month there and then moved over to India for two months. We then spent the rest of the year in Thailand.
                            
                            I decided that during my time away I would teach my self to code properly. I had tried before using platforms like freeCodeCamp, reading ‘how to’ books etc but nothing had ever really gripped me as I never really got to any real world applications…Not this year though, I was going to commit and get results!
                            
                            I found some great courses on Udemy and Im grateful to have found such amazing teachers, who also have amazing students who have also helped me along my journey.

                            I was training in the gym nearly everyday, coding any second that I had free and when I wasn’t, I was reading books on coding. I really threw myself into it and loved it. 
                            
                            Life was great and everything was going well until I caught an infection that would stay with me for the next 9 months. This was quite a blow and was certainly not how I hoped and imagined our year away would end but I look at it now as a blessing in disguise. 
                            
                            I was immobile but this meant that I was still able to code, keep myself busy and really indulge my self into Javascript.

                            This brings us up to date! Apr 2019. I am now healthy and can train again, I still code everyday, working on projects and I am now looking to join a company who I can learn, grow and build with!
